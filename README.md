For Forge servers:

Installer configs - Update config AND jar.

Non-installer configs - Update config only.


In the servers settings Look for JARs in Server base directory.


Run server with the forge installer, this will run the forge installer jar with the --installServer argument.


After it's successful stop the server, change the jar to the non-installer and run the server like normal.
